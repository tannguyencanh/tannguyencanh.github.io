description: I created this software as my own need and served sneakerheads with the opportunity to buy extremely rare sneaker pairs on the market. The software will have many parts for development, but I have developed 2 necessary parts and time-limited for the hackathon 2019. This software uses same purpose with <a href="https://aycd.io/shop/oneclick">AYCD</a>, but it is free. Software called Panda Sole Kicks AIO. It can now support users to create multiple fake addresses to make a profile when buying shoes because each profile is an opportunity to buy. In addition, it can help users of <a href="https://www.reddirtproxies.com/">Red Dirt Proxies</a> automatically create their proxies automatically and faster instead of creating via <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>. In the future, I can develop automated tasks, which means creating hundreds of bots that log into a website to search for items with given keywords and checkout within 1-5s.
