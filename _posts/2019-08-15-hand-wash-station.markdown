description: I was so lucky to attend this program which called solar panel to make a hot water hand wash station. This is not completely related to my major, but I have an inquisitive personality and want to discover everything as I can. My team contains 10 students from other community colleges and transferred to UTK. This program let me study about soldering metal, thermal knowledge, wood and metal cutter, and its safety. This does not only help learn about skills in the engineering field, through this program, I know more friends and this is an important network for looking for the job after graduation. Finally, the hand wash station is built successful and used in Engineering Cookout Day. <a href="http://utkstair.org/clausius/docs/photos/2019_0817/text/2019_0817.html">More picture</a>.
